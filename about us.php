                <h1>A tale of motivation and the search for convenience</h1>
                <p>Two college students studying in Prishtina, Kosovo, were huge fans of high power PCs, especially laptops, but always found it odd how gaming laptops would sacrifice battery life and portability for as much power as possible, so they decided to make their own custom laptops to improve on comfort and battery sustainability, while not limiting the power and performance that a laptop needs to be perfect for gaming.
